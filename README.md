## There are some issues in tuorial which are resolved by me:  
1) First import all the webdriver and chrome driver in script  
(import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;  
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;  
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeOptions;
public)  
2) In build path setup put all the files in class path, not in module path.  
3) Add selenium server stand alone, client and client source to build path.
